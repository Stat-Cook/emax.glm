Description: Implementation of Expectation Maximization (EM) regression of general linear models.
    The package currently supports Poisson and Logistic regression with variable weights, with underlying theory included in the vignettes. 
    New users are recommended to look at the 'em.glm()' and 'small.em()' functions - the outputs of which are supported by 'AIC()', 'BIC()',  and 'logLik()' calls.
    Several plot functions have been included for useful diagnostics and model exploration.
